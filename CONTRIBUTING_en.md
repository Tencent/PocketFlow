You are welcomed to report [issues](https://github.com/Tencent/PocketFlow/issues) or submit [pull requests](https://github.com/Tencent/PocketFlow/pulls). Before contributing, please read the following guideline.

## Issue Management

We use Github Issues to track public bugs and feature requests.

### Search for Existing Issues First

Please search for existing or similar issues before opening a new one, in order to avoid duplicated issues.  

### Creating a New Issue

When creating a new issue, please provide detailed descriptions, screenshots, and/or short videos to help us locate and reproduce the problem(s).

### Branch Management

For the moment, we have only one branch for simplicity:

1. `master` branch:
    1. This is the stable branch. Highly-stable versions will be tagged with certain version numbers.
    2. Please submit hotfixs or new features as PR to this branch.

### Pull Requests (PR)

We welcome everyone to contribute to PocketFlow. Our development team will monitor pull requests and perform related tests and code reviews. If passed, the PR will be accepted and merged to the master branch. 

Before submitting a PR, please confirm the following:

1. Fork the main repo
2. Keep updated with the main repo
3. Update comments and documentation after code changes
4. Add licence and copyright notes to new files
5. Keep the code style consistent (use `run_pylint.sh`)
