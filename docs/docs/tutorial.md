# Tutorial

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to compress a convolutional neural network and export the compressed model into a \*.tflite file for deployment on mobile devices. The model we used here is a 18-layer residual network (denoted as "ResNet-18") trained for the ImageNet classification task. We will compress it with the discrimination-aware channel pruning algorithm (Zhuang et al., NIPS '18) to reduce the number of convolutional channels used in the network for speed-up.

## Prepare the Data

To start with, we need to convert the ImageNet data set (ILSVRC-12) into TensorFlow's native TFRecord file format. You may follow the data preparation guide [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/inception#getting-started) to download the full data set and convert it into TFRecord files. After that, you should be able to find 4,096 training files and 128 validation files in the data directory, like this:

``` bash
# training files
train-00000-of-04096
train-00001-of-04096
...
train-04095-of-04096

# validation files
validation-00000-of-00128
validation-00001-of-00128
...
validation-00127-of-00128
```

## Prepare the Pre-trained Model

The discrimination-aware channel pruning algorithm requires a pre-trained uncompressed model provided in advance, so that a channel-pruned model can be trained with warm-start. You can download a pre-trained model from [here](https://api.ai.tencent.com/pocketflow/list.html), and then unzip files into the `models` sub-directory.

Alternatively, you can train an uncompressed full-precision model from scratch using `FullPrecLearner` with the following command (choose whatever mode that fits you):

``` bash
# local mode with 1 GPU
$ ./scripts/run_local.sh nets/resnet_at_ilsvrc12_run.py

# docker mode with 8 GPUs
$ ./scripts/run_docker.sh nets/resnet_at_ilsvrc12_run.py -n=8

# seven mode with 8 GPUs
$ ./scripts/run_seven.sh nets/resnet_at_ilsvrc12_run.py -n=8
```

After the training process, you should be able to find the resulting model files located at the `models` sub-directory in PocketFlow's home directory.

## Train the Compressed Model

Now, we can train a compressed model with the discrimination-aware channel pruning algorithm, as implemented by `DisChnPrunedLearner`. Assuming you are now in PocketFlow's home directory, the training process of model compression can be started using the following command (choose whatever mode that fits you):

``` bash
# local mode with 1 GPU
$ ./scripts/run_local.sh nets/resnet_at_ilsvrc12_run.py \
    --learner dis-chn-pruned

# docker mode with 8 GPUs
$ ./scripts/run_docker.sh nets/resnet_at_ilsvrc12_run.py -n=8 \
    --learner dis-chn-pruned

# seven mode with 8 GPUs
$ ./scripts/run_seven.sh nets/resnet_at_ilsvrc12_run.py -n=8 \
    --learner dis-chn-pruned
```

Let's take the execution command for the local mode as an example. In this command, `run_local.sh` is a shell script that executes the specified Python script with user-provided arguments. Here, we ask it to run the Python script named `nets/resnet_at_ilsvrc12_run.py`, which is the execution script for ResNet models on the ImageNet data set. After that, we use `--learner dis-chn-pruned` to specify that the `DisChnPrunedLearner` should be used for model compression. You may also use other learners by specifying the corresponding learner name. Below is a full list of available learners in PocketFlow:

| Learner name     | Learner class                | Note                                         |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `full-prec`      | `FullPrecLearner`            | No model compression                         |
| `channel`        | `ChannelPruningLearner`      | Channel pruning [2]                          |
| `dis-chn-pruned` | `DisChnPrunedLearner`        | Discrimination-aware channel pruning [1]     |
| `weight-sparse`  | `WeightSparseLearner`        | Weight sparsification [3]                    |
| `uniform`        | `UniformQuantizedLearner`    | Uniform weight quantization []               |
| `tf-uniform`     | `UniformQuantizedLearnerTF`  | Uniform weight quantization in TensorFlow [] |
| `non-uniform`    | `NonUniformQuantizedLearner` | Non-uniform weight quantization []           |

The local mode only uses 1 GPU for the training process, which takes approximately 20-30 hours to complete. This can be accelerated by multi-GPU training in the docker and seven mode, which is enabled by adding `-n=x` right after the specified Python script, where `x` is the number of GPUs to be used.

Optionally, you can pass some extra arguments to customize the training process. For the discrimination-aware channel pruning algorithm, some of key arguments are:

| Name              | Definition                             | Default Value |
|:------------------|:---------------------------------------|:--------------|
| `enbl_dst`        | Enable training with distillation loss | False         |
| `dcp_prune_ratio` | DCP algorithm's pruning ratio          | 0.5           |

You may override the default value by appending customized arguments at the end of the execution command. For instance, the following command:

``` bash
$ ./scripts/run_local.sh nets/resnet_at_ilsvrc12_run.py \
    --learner dis-chn-pruned \
    --enbl_dst \
    --dcp_prune_ratio 0.75
```

requires the `DisChnPrunedLearner` to achieve an overall pruning ratio of 0.75 and the training process will be carried out with the distillation loss. As a result, the number of channels in each convolutional layer of the compressed model will be one quarter of the original one.

After the training process is completed, you should be able to find a sub-directory named `models_dcp_eval` created in the home directory of PocketFlow. This sub-directory contains all the files that define the compressed model, and we will export them to a TensorFlow Lite formatted model file for deployment in the next section.

## Export to TensorFlow Lite

TensorFlow's checkpoint files cannot be directly used for deployment on mobile devices. Instead, we need to firstly convert them into a single \*.tflite file that is supported by the TensorFlow Lite Interpreter. For model compressed with channel-pruning based algorithms, *e.g.* `ChannelPruningLearner` and `DisChnPrunedLearner`, we have prepared a model conversion script, `tools/conversion/export_pb_tflite_models.py`, to generate a TF-Lite model from TensorFlow's checkpoint files.

To convert checkpoint files into a \*.tflite file, use the following command:

``` bash
# convert checkpoint files into a *.tflite model
$ python tools/conversion/export_pb_tflite_models.py \
    --model_dir models_dcp_eval
```

In the above command, we specify the model directory containing checkpoint files generated in the previous training process. The conversion script automatically detects which channels can be safely pruned, and then produces a light-weighted compressed model. The resulting TensorFlow Lite file is also placed at the `models_dcp_eval` directory, named as `model_transformed.tflite`.

## Deploy on Mobile Devices

After exporting the compressed model to the TensorFlow Lite file format, you may follow the official [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/demo_android) for creating an Android demo App from it. Basically, this demo App uses a TensorFlow Lite model to continuously classifies images captured by the camera, and all the computation are performed on mobile devices in real time.

To use the `model_transformed.tflite` model file, you need to place it in the `asserts` directory and create a Java class named `ImageClassifierFloatResNet` to use this model for classification. Below is the example code, which is modified from `ImageClassifierFloatInception.java` used in the official demo project:

  @Override

    // TODO the following value isn't in [0,1] yet, but may be greater. Why?
    return getProbability(labelIndex);
  }

  @Override
  protected void runInference() {
    tflite.run(imgData, labelProbArray);
  }

```

After that, you need to change the image classifier class used in `Camera2BasicFragment.java`. Locate the function named `onActivityCreated` and change its content as below. Now you will be able to use the compressed ResNet-18 model to classify objects on your mobile phone in real time.

``` Java
/** Load the model and labels. */
@Override
public void onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);
  try {
    classifier = new ImageClassifierFloatResNet(getActivity());
  } catch (IOException e) {
    Log.e(TAG, "Failed to initialize an image classifier.", e);
  }
  startBackgroundThread();
}
```
